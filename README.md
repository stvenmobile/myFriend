# myFriend 🪄🤖

A kid-friendly, desk-sized companion (“the Friend”) that reacts to a **gesture wand**.  
- **Wand:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE recognizes gestures (wave, circle, flick, tickle) and broadcasts them via BLE.  
- **Friend:** ESP32-S3 (or CYD 2.8") shows animated eyes, moves head/arms via servos, and plays sounds — reacting to wand gestures and touch.

myFriend actually consists of two main functional components. The face and body of myFriend are mainly complsed of a head, a CYD 3.5 inch display for eyes and mouth, and two arms with servis to control arm movement.

But the brain of myfriend will be the speech capable robot from my other github repo sophia-robot, which consists of a capable assistant who can respond to queries by contacting ollama, tell stories, give the weather, and so on. This rpository focuses on the body of my friend (head, face, arms), and the interactions with a magic wand. I will figure out the full integration of the two projects later.

> This README refactors and structures the initial outline you provided. (Source: uploaded README draft.)

## Goals
- **Delight 9–12 y/o** with immediate, physical feedback (lights, motion, sound).
- **Simple first build**, deep upgrade path (ML gestures, eyes tracking, story modes).
- **Robust power** and wiring so it survives kid handling.

---

## System Architecture

**Wand (Arduino Nano 33 BLE)**  
- Inputs: Onboard IMU (accelerometer/gyro), optional touch button  
- Outputs/Comms: BLE (GATT notifications), optional NeoPixel ring + piezo  
- Power: 1‑cell LiPo + charger + 5V boost  
- Role: Recognize gestures and stream orientation

**Friend (ESP32‑S3 / CYD 2.8" Display)**  
- Inputs: BLE from wand, capacitive “head touch”, optional ToF distance  
- Outputs: Animated eyes/mouth, 2× SG90 (arms), 1× MG90S (head pan), audio via I2S amp  
- Power: 5V 3–4A adapter (separate 5V rail for servos)  
- Role: React to gestures/touch; track wand with eyes/head; play sounds

**Typical Behaviors**  
- **Wake** via head touch → eyes open, yawn sound, arms stretch  
- **Wave** → Friend waves back  
- **Circle** → “Charging spell” animation + sparkle sound  
- **Flick** → Head nod or shake (direction-based)  
- **Tickle** → Laugh sound + quick arm flails  
- **Eyes follow wand** using yaw/pitch data

## 🧩 Display & Hardware Configuration

### Hybrid Display Architecture

**myFriend** uses a modular two-display design for realism and flexibility:


WAND (Nano BLE) → FRIEND (ESP32-S3 CYD 2.8") → JETSON (Sophia)
     [BLE link]        [MQTT/WiFi link]           [HDMI Panel]



 
| Display | Role | Processor | Typical Content |
|----------|------|------------|-----------------|
| **ESP32-2432S028 CYD 2.8" (ESP32-S3)** | “Face” | ESP32-S3 | Eyes, expressions, gestures, touch input |
| **Optional 7" HDMI IPS (Jetson Orin Nano)** | “Info Panel” | Jetson Orin Nano | Text, math tutoring, images, captions |

The 2.8″ CYD module runs independently as the expressive **face display**, keeping animations responsive and self-contained, while the Jetson handles cognition, speech, and auxiliary visuals.

### 🪞 CYD Face (ESP32-2432S028)

**Module:**  
2.8″ ESP32-2432S028 TFT (ILI9341 320×240) — Wi-Fi + Bluetooth + USB-C development board  
Reference: [Elecrow ESP32-2432S028 GitHub](https://github.com/Elecrow-ESP32-Projects)

#### Key Features
- **Display:** ILI9341 TFT (320×240, SPI)
- **Touch:** XPT2046 resistive controller (SPI)
- **Processor:** ESP32-S3 (8 MB flash, no PSRAM)
- **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi, BLE, USB-C
- **Power:** 5 V input (~150 – 180 mA typical)

#### Recommended Libraries
- `LovyanGFX` (for graphics)
- `XPT2046_Touchscreen` (for touch input)
- `ArduinoJson` or `AsyncMQTTClient` (for telemetry)
- `NimBLE-Arduino` (for BLE wand link)

#### Functional Roles

- Controls **PCA9685** servo controller (arms, head)
- Manages **BLE link** to wand for gestures/orientation
- Publishes/subscribes to **MQTT** topics for Jetson integration
- Optionally plays short local audio via MAX98357A I²S amp

#### Electrical Notes
- **Display SPI** and **touch SPI** are internally wired  
- **Backlight PWM:** GPIO 45  
- **PCA9685 I²C:** SDA = GPIO 8, SCL = GPIO 9 (3.3 V logic, 5 V servo rail)  
- **Audio (MAX98357A):** BCLK = GPIO 14, LRCLK = GPIO 13, DIN = GPIO 12

- **Role:** Displays extended information, dialogue captions, learning content  
- **Software:** Chromium kiosk or custom PyQt app subscribing to MQTT telemetry  

**Integration**
- Publishes `myfriend/friend/cmd/*` (e.g. `say`, `anim`, `expression`)  
- Subscribes to `myfriend/friend/wand` and `myfriend/friend/sensors` for real-time feedback

---

### 🤖 myFriend Integration with sophia-robot  
[https://github.com/stvenmobile/sophia-robot](https://github.com/stvenmobile/sophia-robot)

The Jetson Orin Nano runs the **Sophia** voice and cognition stack, managing:
- **ASR** (speech recognition)  
- **Intent mapping / dialogue control**  
- **TTS** (text-to-speech)  
- **UI output** on the HDMI Info Panel  
- **MQTT exchange** with the ESP32 “face” module

---

### 🔧 Planned Enhancement

The CYD 2.8″ face module will communicate with Sophia via USB CDC, enabling real-time animation commands such as `start_smile`, `start_talking`, and `start_puzzled`.  
This keeps facial expression and voice output synchronized for a more natural human-like interaction.









### myFriend Integration with sophia-robot
https://github.com/stvenmobile/sophia-robot

The Jetson runs **Sophia**, the voice and cognition stack. It handles:
- Speech recognition (ASR)
- Natural language intent mapping
- Text-to-speech (TTS)
- UI output on the HDMI Info Panel

The Sophia repo is linked as a submodule under `brain/sophia-robot/`.

## Bill of Materials

### Wand
- Arduino **Nano 33 BLE**
- 1S **LiPo** (500–850 mAh)
- **TP4056** LiPo charger (with protection)
- **MT3608** boost (3.7V→5V)
- Optional: WS2812 8‑LED ring, piezo, momentary button

### Friend
- **ESP32-S3 CYD 3.5** (ESP32-3248S035C module)
- **PCA9685** 16‑ch servo driver (3.3V logic, 5V servo rail)
- **Servos:** 2× SG90 (arms), 1× **MG90S** (head pan)
- **I2S Amp:** MAX98357A + 3W 4–8Ω speaker (or DFPlayer Mini as alternative)
- Optional: **TTP223** touch sensor; **VL53L0X/L1X** ToF
- **PSU:** 5V 3–4A
- 3D‑printed enclosure... hinges,pivots...

---

## Electrical & Power

### Wand
- Feed Nano via **5V pin** from MT3608 boost. (VIN expects >4.5V; avoids BLE brownouts.)  
- Switch on battery or boost output; expose the TP4056 port for charging.

### Friend
- **Servos on their own 5V rail** (shared GND with MCU). Add **≥1000µF** bulk cap near servo rail.  
- PCA9685 at 50 Hz; VCC=3.3V, V+=5V.  
- Keep I2S amp wiring short; separate audio GND return if possible.

---

## Comms Protocol (BLE)

**Peripheral (Wand)**  
Custom GATT service with three characteristics (Notify enabled):
- `gesture_id` (uint8) — 0=None, 1=Wake, 2=Wave, 3=Circle, 4=Flick, 5=Tickle, …
- `orientation` — either quaternion (4×float32) or packed yaw/pitch (2×int16, mdeg)
- `battery_pct` (uint8)

Notify `orientation` at **20–30 Hz** during motion; lower rate when idle.

**Central (Friend)**  
- Auto‑connect; subscribe to notifications.  
- Lost link → idle animation; touch remains active.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stvenmobile/myFriend.git
   cd myFriend
   ```

2. **Project structure (create folders)**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p firmware/wand firmware/friend hardware/printed assets/sounds docs
   ```

3. **Toolchains**
   - **Wand:** Arduino IDE (or CLI) with `Arduino_LSM9DS1`, `ArduinoBLE`, `Adafruit_NeoPixel` (optional)
   - **Friend:** PlatformIO or Arduino with `NimBLE-Arduino`, `Adafruit_PWMServoDriver` (PCA9685), display lib for CYD, `ESP32 I2S`

4. **First flash**
   - Flash a simple **BLE beacon** on the wand (sends a fixed gesture_id).  
   - Flash **BLE client + eyes idle** on the friend. Verify connect/notify → change face on gesture.

5. **Wire minimal hardware**
   - Friend: ESP32‑S3 + PCA9685 + one servo + speaker; power from 5V adapter.  
   - Wand: Nano 33 BLE + LiPo + TP4056 + MT3608.

## Build Notes & Tips

- **Servos are noisy:** use a separate 5V rail and star‑grounding; bulk caps tame brownouts.  
- **MG90S** for head pan (better holding torque); SG90 are fine for arms.  
- **Eyes follow wand:** low‑pass yaw for head pan; map yaw/pitch to pupil offsets and clamp.  
- Start **rule‑based gestures**; switch to **Edge Impulse** later for ML recognition.  
- If powering Friend from battery later, plan for **2–3A peaks** or servos will reset the MCU.
